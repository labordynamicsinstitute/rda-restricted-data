## Approximate Abstract

Reproducibility and replicability are critical elements of credible scientific research. The American Economic Association verifies reproducibility of the associated computer code prior to publication of articles. However, about 40% of articles use some restricted-access data - data that are subject to non-disclosure agreements, privacy concerns, or proprietary claims. Assessing reproducibility is challenging. This short presentation describes our process of doing so, and identifies a few example paths to using third parties as proxies for journals.
